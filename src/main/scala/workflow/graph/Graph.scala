/**
 * To represent our Keystone workloads under the hood at the lowest level, we use a dataflow-esque DAG-like structure.
 * Data flows through vertices that manipulate it. At this level, everything is fully untyped! All type information
 * as it relates to ML-specific ideas is captured at higher API levels. More specifically, our workload graphs are
 * made up of three types of vertices, Nodes, Sources, and Sinks, with edges between them.
 *
 * Nodes consist of a unique id, and an Operator. Each Node also has zero, one, or multiple ordered dependencies
 * on Nodes and Sources elsewhere in the graph. These dependencies are represented as incoming edges in the DAG,
 * with data flowing into the node. Dependency order matters, as the incoming data is passed directly to the
 * Operator with each dependency as a separate parameter. Operators may take zero, one, or multiple ordered
 * input parameters, and always produce a single output.
 *
 * Next, we have Sources, a special type of vertex. A source is an incomplete input connection coming in from the
 * outside world. A workload cannot be executed without providing information about what data should be passed into
 * each Source. Sources are also treated by utility methods as endpoints of the DAG, useful for specifying how to
 * connect multiple workload DAGs together. Each Source has a unique id, and Sources always have zero
 * dependencies/incoming edges.
 *
 * Finally, we have Sinks, another special type of vertex. Sinks each have a unique id, and exactly one dependency
 * on either a source or a node. Sinks are output endpoints exposed to the outside world. They are used as markers
 * during execution to specify what results of executing a workload to output. Like Sources, they are also referenced
 * by utilities to to connect workloads together. Each Sink has a unique id, and exactly one dependency on either
 * a Node or a Source.
 *
 * @param sources  The set of all [[SourceId]]s of sources in the graph
 * @param sinkDependencies  A map of [[SinkId]] to the id of the node or source the sink depends on
 * @param operators  A map of [[NodeId]] to the operator contained within that node
 * @param dependencies  A map of [[NodeId]] to the node's ordered dependencies
